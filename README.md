# ORUPHONES

## Overview
This Application is used to find the most afforadable old and refurbished mobiles.

The app follows the **Bloc Architecture**, which divides the project into layers:
- **Presentation Layer**: Contains UI and Bloc/Cubit for state management.

- **Data Layer**: Manages API calls, local storage, and repositories.
